/// ANSI Color Codes to beautify Logging
///
/// Paw try to provide a simple and effective way to apply ANSI color codes
/// and styles to text in terminal or console applications. These ANSI codes are
/// special character sequences that control the formatting, such as color and
/// style, of text displayed in environments that support ANSI escape codes.
///
/// For more comprehensive details on ANSI colors, you can visit:
/// [ANSI Colors Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
///
/// To explore more ANSI color options, refer to:
/// [Various ANSI Color Codes](https://talyian.github.io/ansicolors/)
